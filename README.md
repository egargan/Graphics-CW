# OpenGL Project

A scene of a raft on an animated sea created with OpenGL, made as part of coursework for a university 3D graphics module, to demonstrate understanding of modelling, texturing, lighting, and animation.

It features a body of water made from tesselated triangles, and animated using perlin noise to create a wave effect. Specular reflections from the moon (or sun, the scene switches between day and night), highlight this animation. Here's how it looks.
